  comment = {The aim of these lecture notes is to give an introduction to analytic geometry, that is the geometry of complex manifolds, with a focus on the Hodge theory of compact Kähler manifolds. The text comes in two parts that correspond to the distribution of the lectures between the two authors:
- the first part, by Olivier Biquard, is an introduction to Hodge theory, and more generally to the analysis of elliptic operators on compact manifolds.
- the second part, by Andreas Höring, starts with an introduction to complex manifolds and the objects (differential forms, cohomology theories, connections...) naturally attached to them. In Section 4, the analytic results established in the first part are used to prove the existence of the Hodge decomposition on compact Kähler manifolds. Finally in Section 5 we prove the Kodaira vanishing and embedding theorems which establish the link with complex algebraic geometry.},
